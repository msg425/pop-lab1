1. **Scala Basics: Binding and Scope**

  a. The use of pi at line 4 is bounded by line 3. The use of pi at line 7 is bounded by line 1.

  b. The use of x at line 3 is bounded by line 2. The use of x at line 6 is bounded by line 5. The use of x at line 10 is bounded by line 5. The use of x at line 13 is bounded by line 1.

2. **Scala Basics: Typing**

  The function returns a embeded tubple in the form of ((x,y), z) with each x, y, and z as integers.

  > g:((int,int), int) because

    >> a:int because it is assigned in val(a,b) = (1,(x,3))

    >> b:(int, int) because it is assigned in val(a,b) = (1,(x,3))
